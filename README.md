# UKCloud Atmos S3 Storage Examples

This project contains sample code for common operations against
UKCloud's Atmos based Cloud Storage service. Whilst Atmos itslef
supports both an S3 compatible and an EMC native API the samples in this
repository are designed to work with the S3 compatible endpoint only.

## Credentials
In order to provide a common way to pass credentials to the sample code,
each example will expect to be able to get credentials from environment
vairables. Please ensure the following are exported:

```
UKCLOUD_S3_UID
UKCLOUD_S3_SUBTENANT
UKCLOUD_S3_SECRET
UKCLOUD_S3_HOST
```

Linux:
```
export UKCLOUD_S3_UID=abc12345543434324234jdlfkjwsadde
export UKCLOUD_S3_SUBTENANT=A123456678912345
export UKCLOUD_S3_SECRET=ABC2346253HFDG453=
export UKCLOUD_S3_HOST=casxxxx.ukcloud.com
```

Windows:
```
set UKCLOUD_S3_UID=abc12345543434324234jdlfkjwsadde
set UKCLOUD_S3_SUBTENANT=A123456678912345
set UKCLOUD_S3_SECRET=ABC2346253HFDG453=
set UKCLOUD_S3_HOST=casxxxx.ukcloud.com
```

**n.b if you have been provided an Atmos username in the following
format: "abc12345543434324234jdlfkjwsadde/A123456678912345"**  
**The uid is *before* the "/" and the subtenant is *after* the "/"**

Test that the variables are set with:

Linux:
```
echo $UKCLOUD_S3_UID
```

Windows:
```
echo %UKCLOUD_S3_UID%
```
